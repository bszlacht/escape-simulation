# escape-simulation
Slider = simulation speed<br />
0 = clear cell<br />
1 = add wall<br />
2 = place exit<br />
3 = place pedestrian<br />
4 = place fire block<br />
Calc field = calculate escape road for pedestrians using Djikstra like algorithm<br />
Start = start simulation<br />
Note: you can add pedestrians live, but adding walls and fire won't actualize static field!<br />
