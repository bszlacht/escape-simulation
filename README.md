# escape-simulation
Slider = simulation speed
0 = clear cell
1 = add wall
2 = place exit
3 = place pedestrian
4 = place fire block
Calc field = calculate escape road for pedestrians using Djikstra like algorithm
Start = start simulation
Note: you can add pedestrians live, but adding walls and fire won't actualize static field!
